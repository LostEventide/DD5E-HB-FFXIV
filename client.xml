				<name type="string">Au Ra</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p><i>We Xaela are nomads who roam and live off the land. My tribe was no different. Yet though we did no harm to those whose lands we traversed, they treated us as vermin, in their ignorance, they feared us, and that fear manifested as spite and violence.</i></p>
					<p><i>My loved ones and I were cursed at, spat upon, beaten, and worse. It was out of the desire to protect them that I began my research.</i></p>
					<p>--Alaqa the Witch</p>
					<p>The Au Ra are a misunderstood people due to their physical appearance. Their scaled bodies and horns led many to fear them, believing them to be descendants of dragons or demons. This fear led to hate, which gave way to violence, leaving these proud people few in number across the world. These conditions have led the Au Ra to value their families beyond all else.</p>
					<h>Variable Size</h>
					<p>Au Ra are characterized by their curved horns and intricate patterning of scales across their bodies. Sleek and powerful tails extend out from behind the Au Ra. There is a striking difference in height between the males and females of the race, the men ranging from just over 6 feet tall to 7 and a half feet tall, while the women are dwarfed, rarely coming close to 6 feet tall. Their faces contain sharp features and piercing eyes, alluding to their normally serious and sullen demeanor.</p>
					<p>Au Ra tend to dress very modestly, wearing simple robes and lengths of cloth draped over their bodies as cloaks, especially amongst the nomadic Xaela tribes.</p>
					<h>Divided by Blood</h>
					<p>The Auri creation myth tellst he tale of two beings, the Dawn Father and the Dusk Mother. The two kinds of Au Ra have beliefs about their connection to these beings. The dark scaled Xaela are a nomadic people who believe that the blood of the Dusk Mother courses through their veins. The Xaela view themselves as free spirit folk, who roam the lands hunting, gathering, and battling against other roaming tribes, in honor of their ancestors of the past. The light scaled Raen, on the otherhand, scattered to the four winds, from noble Doma to war-torn Hingashi, and even to the great city beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea.</p>
					<h>Peaks, Valleys, and Plains</h>
					<p>The Au Ra's homeland is known as Othard, a region to the far east. A majority of their homeland is covered by sprawling plains known as the Azim Steppe which dominates their country. The Xaela clans travel across this sea of land in close knit tribes. The northern and western reaches of Othard are shielded with high mountain peaks and deep valleys shrouded in mist. To the east extends the Ruby  Sea, beneath which the Raen have made their home, hidden from the world.</p>
					<h>For My Family</h>
					<p>An Au Ra may set off on an adventure for any number of reasons. A thirst for adventure may awaken in them and draw them from their isolated clan lives, or an act against their clan or tribe may have forced them to action.</p>
					<p>This could go as far as searching for lost family members, or seeking revenge for a slight against their family. For the Au Ra, family is extremely important to them, and may serve a central purpose to drive them to explore the world.</p>
					<h>Au Ra Names</h>
					<p>The Au Ra approach names in two starkly different ways. The Xaela see many names shared across tribes, but there are as many spellings for the same name as there are tribes. Xaela take the name of their tribeas their surname. The Raen name themselves in their tongue in a way that their name carries meaning. Only those belonging to the ruling and warrior class of society legally have surnames, whime commoners may take a surname, it is not legally recognized. Raen who are in power often take surnames related to their feats in battle, while commoners take names related to their profession.</p>

				<name type="string">Elezen</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p><i>For centuries, our nation has been punished for the sins of our forefathers. If our punishment is to end, I believe we must right the wrongs of antiquity and move forward as a nation united. Needless to say, my father did not share this opinion.</i></p>
					<p>--Ser Aymeric de Borel, Lord Commander of the Holy See</p>
					<p>The Elezen are a race divided within themselves, and their often arrogant attitudes keep the other races at an arms reach. The Wildwood live off the lush forests, using their keen eyes to hunt and gather in the dense forests or live in the religious oligarchy of Ishgard, cut off from rest of the world. The Duskwights in contrast are notorious for thievery and pillaging. Spending much of their live in caves and caverns hidden in the forest.</p>
					<h>Elegance and Pride</h>
					<p>Long legs, slender bodies, pointed ears and sharp features are all marks of an elezen. Only rivaling their otherworld appearance is the poise with which they carry themselves. Their tall, thin frames only differ within the race by the colour of their skin. All Elezen try to clothe themselves whenever it is appropriate, valuing their appearance.</p>
					<h>Difference of Opinion</h>
					<p>The Elezen race is divided due to their pride. The Wildwood and Duskwights found they could not coexist and distanced themselves from one another. The Wildwood believing they are the true rulers of the forests in which they live and hold dominion. The largest population of Wildwood Elezen live in Ishgard, a massive religious city embroiled in a war against dragonkind, closed off from much of the world. The Duskwights, who made their homes in the cavern systems of the forests have since been driven to crime to survive due to the Wildwood's clutch on the boundaries of the forest.</p>
					<h>The Woods and the North</h>
					<p>The forest which the Elezen live is the Black Shroud, a massive forest brought to order by the Wildwood, who protect the forest from poachers and other threats which would encroach on it. Duskwights, who disregard the need to protect the forest and hunt to their content. Looking to the Northern city of Ishgard, towering spires, homes and a grand cathedral hide behind their giant gates. Living conditions in Ishgard are rough, as the poor go hungry in the lower levels of the city, while the wealthy live in exuberance, looking down on the less fortunate citizens, ruled by the religious teachings of the Holy See.</p>
					<h>Honour and Vengeance</h>
					<p>An Elezen may set out on an adventure for many different reasons. An Ishgardian Wildwood hungry for revenge against the dragons may set out to seek greater strength, while another may take up arms to defend their forest home from an encroaching threat against the Black Shroud. Duskwights may set out to gain honour and riches to support their family or to prove to the world they are more than just a thief. Perhaps you seek glory in battle, and head out to find this fame.</p>
					<h>Elezen Names</h>
					<p>Both the Wildwood and Duskwight clans of Elezen spell their names very similarly. Men's names are longer and always in <i>-loix, -aux, -mont, or -geant.</i> A female's name will always end in <i>-ne, -ette, -elle, or -ie.</i></p>
					<p>Despite the similarity in their first names, the Elezen tribes over time claimed surnames for either side. These surnames will never cross clans, but only those who live within the race will know the difference.</p>
					<p><b>Male Elezen Names:</b> Adeux, Beichault, Dreauchant, Eauplaux, Etrent, Gloffaux, Jodeaux, Joyent, Ulmant, Ulwex</p>
					<p><b>Female Elezen Names:</b> Adreanne, Iflione, Eaupline, Eranne, Etrene, Moriene, Peronne, Cummone, Phivonne, Paxeonne</p>
					<p><b>Elezen Surnames:</b> Breaunojuste, Douvionne, Feajorins, Gehon, Glauvefand, Grurubont, Nahame, Prihaux, Shogamie, Zuhepane</p>

					<p><i>Thal's Balls...I'd forgotten what it was like to feel so alive! Not since leaving the bloodsands have I had the privilege. Not since the Bull of Ala Mhigo hung up his swords. Back then, the outcome might have been different. But I do not begrudge you your victory. I know how far you have come, how much you have endured. Our fight only confirmed it. We shall have to do this again one day, when time allows.</i></p>
					<p>--Raubahn Aldynn, The Bull of Ala Mhigo</p>
					<p>Around 1000 years ago, the Hyur spread across the land in a great migration from the north. They made their homes wherever they could set their footing. Some took to the mountains, while others found a foot hold in any city which would accept them. Today the Hyur are one of the most populous races in the world.</p>
					<h>Of Average Build</h>
					<p>The Hyur are a race of average sized humanoids whom one may view as an average group of people, lacking distinguishing features such as pointed ears, immense size or horns. Over time Hyur have diverged into two distinct groups, the Midlanders and Highlanders. Midlanders are widespread across the land and come in all shapes and colours, becoming prevelant in all cities. Highlanders in comparison are taller than their Midlander counterparts, boasting a more powerful, muscular build.</p>
					<h>A Matter of Location</h>
					<p>The differences between the Midlanders and Highlanders was born from their homes long ago. The Highlanders are named for living at a high elevation, mountains in particular. These tough living conditions lead to a heartier, more physically powerful people. The Midlanders lived at sea level and across the world, which minimized changes due to life in extreme conditions.</p>
					<h>People of the World</h>
					<p>Hyur as a whole make up a large percentage of the population in the world. Over a thousand years ago the Hyur immigrated in massive waves from their homelands and made their homes wherever their feet hit the ground. Highlanders are a special case within the Hyur, famed for their mountainous city of Ala Mhigo. In recent years, the Ala Mighans were forced from their homes to immigrate across the world, mixing into the cities across the world themselves.</p>
					<h>Glory and Prosperity</h>
					<p>The Hyur are a hardworking and ambitious people, no matter what walk of life they come from. It is for this reason that for every Hyur in the world, there could be a different reason to seek adventure. Some may head out on the road for the value of the journey itself, while others may do so in search of riches. Some Hyur may be adventuring on another's behalf, perhaps their family sitting at home, or to defend their people from an imminent threat. In a world with so many possibilities, it does not take much convincing to bring a Hyur to action.</p>
					<h>Hyur Names</h>
					<p>The names of the Hyur are in the common tongue of the land. Midlander may take names which are appropriate for the culture in which they live while Highlanders take names which have a harshness in their pronunciation. As a surname, Midlanders will often take a descriptive name for their physical traits or profession. Highlanders prefer to earn their surnames in battle, using feats of martial prowess or names with violent imagery.</p>
					<p><b>Male Midlander Names:</b> Odard, Redwald, Kenward, Herebert, Acwuld, Edward, Roderic, Eadwine</p>
					<p><b>Female Midlander Names:</b> Rowena, Hilda, Agatha, Hrodwyn, Goldyna, Hounild, Edusa, Beyhild, Mathilda, Tonild, Somerhild, Rimilde</p>

					<p><i>But I will see them suffer no longer. The victory feast shall provide the stage on which I declare the dissolution of the sultanate. 'Tis mine intent that the ruling class of our golden city should take its place beside the common man in a fair and equitable republic. No more shall this nation bow to the whims of a privileged few.</i></p>
					<p>--Nanamo Ul Namo, Sultana of Ul'dah</p>
					<p>The Lalafell are generally a cheery race of people. Long ago the Lalafell lived as masters of agriculture and spread across the land along trade routes, selling their produce and becoming one of the most widespread races there is. In time, the Dunesfolk went as far as establishing their own desert city-state known as Ul'dah. These tiny folk are highly ambitious and are not afraid to take hold of opportunity when it appears before them.</p>
					<h>Tiny Yet Mighty</h>
					<p>Lalafell anatomy sees these kindly people rarely growing to be 3 feet tall. Their short bodies are rotund, with short feeble looking legs. But appearances can be deceiving as Lalafell bodies are highly efficienct, allowing them to travel long distances on their short legs. The Plainsfolk have larger, pointed ears which greatly improve their hearing, while the Dunesfolk developed a film which covers their eyes, protecting them from the sun and sand of the desert. Additionally, out of tradition, Dunesfolk will place gemstones associated with their zodiacal sign on their foreheads.</p>
					<h>Products of the Land</h>
					<p>The Lalafellin homelands produced two types of people, from which they take their names. The Plainsfolk started off as agriculturalists living their lives on their farms, eventually trading their goods across the land, leading to Lalafells spreading across the world. The Dunesfolk began and remain as desert-dwelling folk, their bodies adapting to the harsh conditions.</p>
					<h>Rolling Planes and Towering Dunes</h>
					<p>The Lalafell can trace their ancestry back to two key areas. The Plainsfolk began as farmers on fertile islands in the south, farming the lands of their namesake. The Dunesfolk were not so lucky to have farmable land and isntead turned to animal husbandry. Traditionally, Dunesfolk built their homes on the backs of beasts of burden, traveling with their herds. Eventually the Dunesfolk founded a great city of wealth, where nearly all Dunesfolk live today.</p>
					<h>Family and Fortune</h>
					<p>Lalafells care deeply for their small families and would do anything for them. They may set out on an adventure to support their families or in their defense. Not all Lalafells have such pure goals thouugh, as many contain a great deal of ambition in their tiny bodies. Merchants travel all over the land, researchers seek knowledge in secret places, and sellswords bravely take jobs to prove themselves. Lalafells may be small, but they take on the world in a big way.</p>
					<h>Lalafell Names</h>
					<p>Both the Plainsfolk and the Dunesfolk name themselves using set rhyming schemes, ruled by rhythm and repetition. Syllables are combined in various combinations to form playful sounding names. This means that Lalafells generally do not have surnames unless they come from royalty, which adds their family name in the middle. Each gender and subrace of Lalafell have their own ruleset detailed below. Each letter indicates a syllable or pair of syllables.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p><i>The Nunh that I once fought also believed that his strrrength would save him. He was wrong, and I am now Nunh. Many years ago I joined the Company of Heroes to hone my skills instead of challenging my predecessor before I was ready. Even when I was young I understood that victorrrry goes to the patient, the cunning, the pragmatic.</i></p>
					<p>--U'odh Nunh, leader of the Drake Tribe</p>
					<p>The Miqo'te are an aloof people who value their independence from the world. Centuries ago the Miqo'te migrated, Seekers spreading across the world in low numbers while Keepers found dense forests as a new home. Traditionally they avoid the other races, but over time more and more Miqo'te have integrated into society with pockets of die hard traditional Miqo'te tribes surviving out in the world.</p>
					<h>Lithe Hunters</h>
					<p>The Miqo'te are a feline race with large catlike ears, fanged teeth, and long tails. They have a highly tuned sense of smell and powerful legs, which have allowed them to become natural hunters. The Seekers of the Sun's ears are wider with thicker fur, while the Keepers of the Moon's ears are longer and stylized, with shorter fur. Futhermore, the eyes of the Seekers has developed such that the pupils are slit, to help guard their eyes from the exposure of the sun, while the Keepers' pupils have become large and rounded. Many more women are born into the tribes and clans of the Miqo'te people.</p>
					<h>Of Suns and Moons</h>
					<p>The Seekers or the Sun and Keepers of the Moon are two distinct ethnicities falling under the Miqo'te. Their cultures differ greatly down to the social structures of their groups. The Seekers live in male dominant societies centered around an alpha male known as the Nunh, and worship the god Azeyma. In constrast the Keepers live in a matriarchical society and worship the goddess Menphina.</p>
					<h>Arid Sands and Dense Woods</h>
					<p>The hot, arid deserts of Southern Thanalan are home to one of the most famed tribes of the Seekers of the Sun. Seekers can be found anywhere across the world, barring cold regions with a harsh winter climate. Those who integrate into larger cities tend to discard their tribal ties and take up the social norms of the city in which they live. Keepers of the Moon have taken to the dense forests away from the heat of the sun.</p>
					<h>Adventure Calls</h>
					<p>The Miqo'te tend to differ on their approach to life depending on their ethnicity. The Seekers of the Sun are bold individuals who are quick to jump into action, but also become bored easily. This natural need for excitement may call a Miqo'te to action, leading them out into the world to explore. Those from traditional tribes may leave their tribe seeking to start their own clan of Seekers, becoming the alpha of their group.</p>
					<p>Keepers are guarded and brooding, which may stall them from setting out on a journey, but when the need arises to protect family, friends or their home, a Keeper will stop at nothing to protect that which they cherish.</p>
					<h>Miqo'te Names</h>
					<p>Seekers of the Sun use a simple naming convention. Male names are one or two syllables and preceded by a letter which is associated with the tribe. The extra aitches (H) we see in names represent a slight hissing/spitting sound that is made when the name is pronounced by the cat-like Miqo'te. Many of the other races in Eorzea cannot accurately reproduce this sound, so the aitches (H) end up going silent when read. They do not take a family name, but instead are given the name Tia at birth. A Tia may change their surname to Nunh by challenging the tribe's breeding male and defeating him in battle. If successful, the two trade titles. Female Seekers' first names are given in the same way with three or more syllables, but the surname is the first name of the breeding male who sired her.</p>
					<p>The tribal prefix often gets dropped in casual conversation and with close friends and family.</p>
					<p>The female Keepers use one to two syllable first names without a tribal prefix due to their small communities. Additionally, in their culture the mother's surname is passed on to the children. The males born into the Keepers' communities take both of their mother's names, adding a suffix to the end of their first name to indicate their birth order counting the males.

			<roegadyn>
				<name type="string">Roegadyn</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p><i>They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say. But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay.</i></p>
					<p>--Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn</p>
					<p>The Roegadyn are a physically powerful race of people with a thirst for life which few can rival. They live loudly with boisterous voices, larger than life goals and an unflinching approach to danger. Roegadyns are fearless explorers who long ago were the greatest pirates to sail the seas. Adventure is in their blood.</p>
					<h>Size Matters</h>
					<p>Roegadyn are enormous humanoids with a hulking muscular build. Men and women alike grow to tower over the other races. Partly due to their size, Roegadyn as a whole love competitions of strength and courage, challenging one another to push themselves and their bravery. Their faces have fierce features and large flat noses. Due to their large size, Roegadyn tend to wear durable, flexible clothing which allows them to move easily.</p>
					<h>Maritime Reavers, Volcanic Hermits</h>
					<p>The Sea Wolves live up to their names through a storied history on the ocean. Most Sea Wolf communities can be found on the coast, as most make their living from the sea. Be it sailing, naval service or mercenary work, the Sea Wolves continue to feel most at home when adventuring on board a ship. The Hellsguard in comparison live in land around the volcanic mountains of abalathia. Here they guard the material plane from undead spirits trying to return home.</p>
					<h>The Great Seas and Abalathia</h>
					<p>The Roegadyn as an entire race hail from the Northern seas, their name translating to people of the rain. These sea fairing people can be found living in coastal citites the world over living as sailors, mercenaries and pirates.</p>
					<p>The Hellsguard live around the volcanoes of the Abalathia mountains, believing their home to be a sacred place related to the afterlife. Those Hellsguard who choose to leave their mountain homes can be found in large cities near these mountains, making a living as sellswords or chasing deeper knowledge of magic.</p>
					<h>In Their Nature</h>
					<p>The Roegadyn people are a boisterous race, seeking out challenges to test their power and bravery.</p>
					<p>They rarely need much convincing to head into the heat of battle for a cause they believe in, though coin may help speed them along. Sea Wolves have a long history of pirating, looting and battle on ships of all sorts, giving them a deep seeded thirst for adventure. Hellsguard grow up in solitude away from society, having no city to call their own. They may decide to head off in search of a more engaging existence by heading down their mountain and seeing what else the world has to offer.</p>
					<h>Roegadyn Names</h>
					<p>Sea Wolves and Hellsguard follow very different rules when it comes to naming conventions. Sea Wolves all derive their names by combining two words from their ancient Roegadyn Language. Women of the Sea Wolves also derrive their names by combining two words, but the second word is always one of eight words. Sea Wolves form their surnames by taking their parent's name and adding a third word; <i>syn</i> for males and <i>wyn</i> for females, indicating they are a son or daughter respectively.</p>
					<p>Hellsguard on the other hand avoid their ancient language and use the common tongue. Their names are formed using two words as well, often drawing inspiration from nature. Women of the Hellsguard tend to use plant imagery in their names as well, but are not restricted to do so. Nearly all Hellsguard abandon their family names, refusing to be defined by their ancestors in the past.</p>
					<p><b>Male Seawolf Names:</b> Klynnahct, Flazfolg, Roehahtyn, Broenstymm, Haergeiss, Nedyrsatz, Unsynfarr</p>
					<p><b>Female Seawolf Names:</b> Rhotbryda, Hezzwyb, Rhenbryda, Grynegeim, Ketenbryda, Skaenswys, Swozthota, Wyznthota, Rhotbryda, Trahggeim</p>
					<p><b>Male Hellsguard Names:</b> Aware Sun, Major Wind, Blue Yew, Grateful Forest, Surprised Cavern, Bright Island, Flawed Lake, Fearless Oak, Dirt Snow, Stark Crow</p>

					<p>A woman stands before a group of goblins. Negotiations have broken down and the goblins have drawn their blades. Before they can take a step towards her, she unleashes a lethal bullet from her pistol, laying their leader low, causing the others to retreat in fear of this unknown weaponry.</p>
					<p>Carefully, an exhausted machinist puts the finishing touches on their newest creation. They flip the switch and the small tower shaped machine takes flight. It receives its commands and a tiny pistol lets loose a bullet destroying the target. A smile spreads across the master tinkerer's face.</p>
					<p>The grinding gears of the clockwork construct click away as it follows its master onto the battle field. The machinist commands their mammet to rush the battlefield. Unwavering the small solider dashes forward, striking out with it's specially crafted blade.</p>
					<p>Machinists have spent many hours in the workshop to progress the art of war. From the creation of firearms, to the production of mechanical constructs for the battle field, the machinist ensure the gears of war continue to turn ever efficiently.</p>

					<h>In the Name of Advancement</h>
					<p>When a Machinist completes their new arms and weapons, there are few in the world who are able to use them. For that reason, it falls upon the Machinist themself to head out into the world to field test their creations. From the deadliest of rifles to the fastest motorized vehicles, the Machinist must push their creations to their limit and continue to modify them. As adventurer's this is the drive of a machinist, to test their equipment and rework it on a long journey in the name of science and innovation.</p>
					<h>Creating a Machinist</h>
					<p>When creating a machinist you must keep in mind why they may be heading out on their adventure. Is your machinist field testing their inventions, or seeking inspiration to create even more intricate machines? Perhaps they are on a journey to make the world a better place by bestowing their creations for the common man. A Machinist has the most advanced technology at their finger tips and are using that technology to make life more efficient. Another possibility is their natural curiousity has taken hold and your character may just be setting out on the journey for the sake of it.</p>

							<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p>
							<h>Cantrips</h>
							<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p>
							<h>Mana</h>
							<p>The Bard table shows how much mana you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend mana to create a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i> and have up to 2nd-level spells available, you can cast <i>cure wounds</i> at either 1st or 2nd level.</p>
							<h>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h>
							<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</p>
							<p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
							<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level you can cast.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Ability</h>
							<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
							<p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
							<h>Ritual Casting</h>
							<p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Focus</h>
							<p>You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>

							<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p>
							<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>
							<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

							<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
							<h>Cantrips</h>
							<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>
							<h>Preparing and casting Spells</h>
							<p>The Cleric table shows how much mana you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend mana to create a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cherlic level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level you can cast.</p>
							<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you can cast up to 2nd-level spells. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
							<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Ability</h>
							<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

							<h>Domain Spells</h>
							<p>Each domain has a list of spells--its domain spells--that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

							<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
							<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>
							<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>
							<h>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h>
							<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
							<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

No matter their reason for fighting, the dragoon is a master of aerial combat whose unique skillset grants them the high ground in any situation.</p>

							<h>Mana</h>
							<p>The Sorcerer table shows how much mana you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend mana to create a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>burning hands</i> and can cast up to 2nd-level spells, you can expend mana to make a spell slot of either 1st or 2nd level.</p>
							<h>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h>
							<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>

							<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level you can cast.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Ability</h>
							<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

							<h>Careful Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 mana and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</p>
							<h>Distant Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 mana to double the range of the spell.</p>
							<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 mana to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p>
							<h>Empowered Spell</h>
							<p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 mana to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>
							<p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>
							<h>Extended Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 mana to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p>
							<h>Heightened Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 mana to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p>
							<h>Quickened Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 mana to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>
							<h>Subtle Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 mana to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p>
							<h>Twinned Spell</h>
							<p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of mana equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 mana if the spell is a cantrip).</p>
							<p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, <i>magic missile</i> and <i>scorching ray</i> aren't eligible, but <i>ray of frost</i> and <i>chromatic orb</i> are.</p>

							<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords, and in any single Charisma skill of your choice. Your hit points maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
							<p>Additionally, whenever you learn a sorcerer cantrip, you may choose the <i>eldritch blast</i> cantrip. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric or druid spell lists instead of the sorcerer spell lists. These spells must involve manipulating or dealing damage with fire, ice, lightning, wind, water, or earth, or they must heal, enhance, or provide succor to allies in some way. You must otherwise obey all restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you of one level higher than it normally would be. For example, you could learn <i>cure wounds</i> as a 2nd-level spell, <i>lesser restoration</i> as a 3rd-level spell, or <i>tsunami</i> as a 9th-level spell.</p>

							<p>When you choose this archetype at 1st level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by the use of your mana.</p>
							<p>You learn three special flair techniques from the list below. You learn two additional techniques of your choice at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new technique, you can also replace one technique you know with a different one.</p>
							<h>Technique Choices</h>
							<p>These are the flair techniques that a red mage can learn. These abilities are all fueled by mana. If these abilities call for a saving throw, the DC is equal to your spell save DC. Unless otherwise stated, each technique can only be used once at a time.</p>
							<h>Corps-a-Corps</h>
							<p>As an action, you may spend 2 mana to move up to your movement speed in a straight line without provoking attacks of opportunity, providied you end this movement adjacent to an enemy. You then make a single melee weapon attack against. On hit, the attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage. This force damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
							<h>Displacement</h>
							<p>As an action, you may spend 2 mana to disengage from an adjacent enemy, moving up to your movement speed in a straight line away from an enemy you are adjacent from. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This movement allows you to travel over the heads of medium or smaller creatures and objects by leaping over them. When you land, you may cast a cantrip targeting the creature you disengaged from.</p>
							<h>Embolden</h>
							<p>As an action, you may spend 2 mana to grant an ally other than yourself within 30 feet of you a bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This bonus deteriorates by 1 every round. You may target additional targets with this ability, spending 2 mana for each target beyond the first.</p>
							<h>Fleche</h>
							<p>As a bonus action, you may spend 2 mana to make a spell attack against a target within 30 feet. This attack deals force damage equal to your weapon's damage, applying any modifiers as if you had struck them with a melee weapon attack. You may make additional attacks with this ability, up to a maximum number equal to your Proficiency bonus, spending 2 mana for every attack beyond the first.</p>
							<h>Flourish</h>
							<p>You may spend 2 mana to reroll any Dexterity ability check or saving throw. You must use this result.</p>
							<h>Follow My Lead</h>
							<p>As a bonus action, you may move an ally who is lower in the initiative order than you up in the order, such that they act directly after you. This costs an amount of mana equal to half the difference between your initiative result and theirs, rounded down (minimum 1).</p>
							<h>Heroic Charm</h>
							<p>You may spend 2 mana to reroll any Charisma ability check or saving throw. You must use this result.</p>
							<h>Moulinet</h>
							<p>As an action, you may spend 2 mana to make a melee attack against every creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you.</p>
							<h>Parry</h>
							<p>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 mana to reduce the damage by your Charisma modifier plus your Dexterity modifier.</p>
							<h>Impact</h>
							<p>When you damage a target with a cantrip or spell of 1st-level or higher, you may spend 1 mana to attempt to blast them off of their feet. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. You may attempt this on additional targets damaged by a spell you cast, spending 1 mana for each target beyond the first.</p>
							<h>In Good Company</h>
							<p>As a reaction, you may spend 1 mana when an ally makes a Charisma check or saving throw to add a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to their roll.</p>
							<h>Redoublement</h>
							<p>When you score a critical hit, you may spend 2 mana to make an extra attack as a bonus action. If this attack connects, the attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage. This force damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
							<h>Riposte</h>
							<p>When a character misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 mana to make a melee attack against the creature. If this attack connects, the attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage. This force damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
							<h>Scatter</h>
							<p>When you cast a cantrip, as a reaction, you may agitate the magic, causing it to explode, allowing you to target each creature within 10 feet of the target. You must spend 1 mana for each target affected beyond the first.</p>
							<h>Verspell</h>
							<p>You are able to conserve mana by compressing your magic into all-or-nothing bursts. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that allows one to take half effects on a success, you may the spell have no effects on a success instead. If you do, the spell counts as one level lower than normal. A 1st-level spell modified in this way costs 1 mana.</p>
							<h>Zwerchhau</h>
							<p>When you strike a single creature with two or more attacks in a single round, you may carve an enchanted, burning mark into the target as a bonus action. At the beginning of the target's next turn, it takes 1d12 fire damage. This fire damage increases by 1d12 at 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).</p>

					<spellcasting>
						<name type="string">Spellcasting</name>
						<level type="number">1</level>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>
							<h>Cantrips</h>
							<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>
							<h>Spellbook</h>
							<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
							<h>Preparing and Casting Spells</h>
							<p>The Wizard table shows how much mana you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend mana to create a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level you can cast.</p>
							<p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you can cast up to 2nd-level spells. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <i>magic missile </i>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
							<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Ability</h>
							<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p><b>Spell save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
							<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
							<h>Ritual Casting</h>
							<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
							<h>Spellcasting Focus</h>
							<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
							<h>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h>
							<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</p>
							<p><b>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>
							<h>Your Spellbook</h>
							<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
							<p><b>Copying a Spell into the Book</b></p>
							<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
							<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>
							<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
							<p><b>Replacing the Book</b></p>
							<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book--for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>
							<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
							<p><b>The Book's Appearance</b></p>
							<p>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>

							<p>At the 2nd level when you choose this tradition, you master a ritual that allows you to create a special boon to help you on your path of mastering arcane magics. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>
							<h>Summoned Companion</h>
							<p>If you choose this option, you gain the ability to summon a carbuncle.</p>
							<p>Choose two carbuncle varieties. You have the requisite gemstones for summoning these carbuncles. At 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you may select another kind of carbuncle. You may summon this carbuncle, but you must aquire a gemstone worth 100gp to do so.</p>
							<p>To summon a carbuncle you must spend one hour performing a ritual upon the magicked gemstone. You may then summon this summoned companion as a bonus action, or dismiss it (no action required). When summoned, your companion gains all benefits of your Carbuncle's Bond ability, listed below. You may only summon one companion at a time. If your companion strays farther than one mile from you, or if you are killed or knocked unconscious, their bond to you and the material plane are severed, causing them to disperse. If your companion disperses in this way, or if your carbuncle reaches 0 hit points, the gemstone is destroyed, and must be replaced.</p>
							<p><b>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>
							<p><b>Carbuncle's Bond</b></p>
							<p>The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are absent from where the companion is operating, it acts on its own.</p>
							<p>Your summoned companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a summoned companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</p>
							<p>Your summoned companion has proficiency in two skills that you choose. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws, and has advantage on all saving throws while within 30 feet of you.</p>
							<p>For each level you gain after 2nd, your summoned companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>
							<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, or it can take a feat (if approved by your GM). As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>

							<h>Aetheric Weapon</h>
							<p> You can use your action to create a special aetheric weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and may be used as an arcane focus for your wizard spells.</p>
							<p>Your aetheric weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
							<p>You can transform one Magic Weapon into your aetheric weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your aetheric weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your aetheric weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
							<h>Arcanist Grimoire</h>
							<p>By practicing an abundance of new geometric and aetheric patterns, you begin to unlock the secrets of magic within your grimoire. When you gain this feature, choose three Cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the grimoire is on your person, you can cast those Cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of Cantrips known. If they don't appear on the arcanist spell list, they are nonetheless arcanist Spells for you.</p>
							<p>If you lose your grimoire, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous book.</p>

When you use your Arcane Recovery class feature, you may also restore your Aetherflow to the maximum.</p>
							<p>You may expend one aetherflow to reroll any damage roll, but must use the new number. Additionally, Aetherflow is used to fuel special techniques called Tactical Maneuvers. You may select two tactical maneuvers, plus an additional maneuver at 10th and 18th level. These are special combat skills used in collaboration with your summoned carbuncle, allies, or your own martial ability. You may use a tactical maneuver on your turn by expending one aetherflow when the proper circumstances are met.</p>
							<h>Tactical Maneuvers</h>
							<h>Bane</h>
							<p>When you or your carbuncle provoke a saving throw from an enemy, you may expend one aetherflow to cause the attack or effect to strike a second creature within 10 feet of the first target. The attack or spell must not be able to affect more than one target without this ability.</p>
							<h>Bind</h>
							<p>When you or your carbuncle lands an attack, you may expend one aetherflow as a bonus action to attempt to bind a creature. The target of the attack must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a binding ethereal chain bursts forth surrounding the target, shackling them. The creature is considered restrained. If your carbuncle landed the attack, they can drag or carry the restrained creature with them, but their speed is halved. At the end of the restrained creature's turn, they may make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, ending the condition on a success.</p>
							<h>Deployment Tactics</h>

							<h>False Fear</h>
							<p>When you or your carbuncle lands an attack, you may expend one aetherflow as a bonus action to attack their mind as well. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, their mind is infested with an illusion causing them to become frightened of the source of the attack. At the end of the frightened creature's turn, they may repeat this saving throw, ending the condition on a success.</p>
							<h>Follow-Up</h>
							<p>When you take the attack action or cast a spell, you may expend one aetherflow as a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.</p>
							<h>Inspire</h>
							<p>When you or your carbuncle makes an attack or casts a spell, you may expend one aetherflow as a bonus action to create a pulse of positive energy from either one of the targets of the attack or the source of the attack. Allies within 10 feet of the source of the pulse have advantage on the next attack roll they make until the end of their next turn.</p>
							<h>Shine</h>
							<p>When you or your carbuncle makes an attack or casts a spell, you may expend one aetherflow as a bonus action to create a flash of light from either one of the targets of the attack or the source of the attack. All hostile creatures who can see the source of the attack within 10 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. At the end of the blinded creature's turn, they may repeat this saving throw, ending this condition on a success.</p>
							<h>Switching Step</h>
							<p>As a bonus action, you may expend one aetherflow stack to switch places with your carbuncle instantly if the carbuncle is within 60 feet of you, or with any willing ally within 30 feet.</p>
